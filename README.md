# RoadLaneDetection
Project Title: Road Lane Detection Using Edge Detection in Python

Project Description:
The Road Lane Detection project is an implementation of computer vision techniques to detect and track road lanes in real-time using edge detection algorithms. The goal of this project is to assist autonomous vehicles or advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS) in identifying and understanding the road structure for lane keeping and lane departure warning systems.

This project utilizes Python as the primary programming language and leverages popular computer vision libraries such as OpenCV to perform edge detection and lane detection tasks. The overall pipeline of the project involves several key steps, including image preprocessing, edge detection, lane detection, and visualization.

The process begins with capturing or loading input video frames or images. Preprocessing techniques, such as resizing, grayscale conversion, and Gaussian blurring, are applied to enhance the image quality and reduce noise. Then, the Canny edge detection algorithm is utilized to detect edges within the image. This step helps to identify potential lane markings present in the scene.

Once the edges are detected, the Hough transform algorithm is employed to extract lines from the edge map. The Hough transform converts the edge points into a parameter space representation, where lines can be extracted by finding intersecting peaks. These lines represent the lane markings or boundaries.

Next, post-processing steps are performed to filter out irrelevant lines and determine the left and right lane boundaries. This can involve techniques such as line segment clustering, slope analysis, and region of interest (ROI) masking to isolate the lanes and remove noise or false detections.

Finally, the detected lane boundaries are overlaid on the original image or video frames to visualize the results. This provides a clear representation of the detected lanes, aiding in further analysis or decision-making processes.

The project aims to provide a robust and efficient solution for road lane detection, allowing autonomous vehicles or ADAS systems to navigate the roads safely and accurately. It serves as a foundation for building more advanced features, such as lane departure warnings, lane change assistance, or autonomous lane keeping.
